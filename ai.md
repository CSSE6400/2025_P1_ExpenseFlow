# Use of AI
Overuse of AI can create code that we do not otherwise understand which could hinder project development. As such, ChatGPT and copilot was used sparingly throughout the project with main uses in the front end and report generation. 

## Front End
ChatGPT was used predominantly to help with front end developement. This was primarly to save time for ui design, and help navigate Flutters various "quirks" when integrating with the back end. 

ui/lib/common - Aproximatly 30% of these files contain ai generated code from a combination of ChatGPT4o and Copilot.

ui/lib/screens - Approximately 20% of these files contain ai generted content. AI was used to help make some of the intiial screens and these components have been resused, edited and adjsuted throughtout the other screens. Mainly ChatGPT4o was used but also a bit of Copilot.

## Report Generation Plug-in
api/src/expenseflow/plugin/report_gen.py - Approximately 80% AI generated with ChatGPT4o.
